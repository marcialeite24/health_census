## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a healthcare data analysis interface that collects and manages patient data, enabling dynamic reporting and data-driven decision-making. The application uses HTML for the user interface and JavaScript for managing and analyzing data. It is designed to filter patients based on health conditions and age groups, dynamically generating reports with statistical insights.

## Project Features
The application includes the following main features:
  - **Interactive Data Input Interface:**
    - Collect patient details such as name, gender, age, and medical condition using HTML forms.
    - Validate user inputs and handle various input types (text, radio buttons, numbers, and dropdowns).
  - **Data Processing and Analysis:**
    - Store and manage patient data using arrays of objects.
    - Filter patient data based on specific conditions (e.g., age group, medical condition).
  - **Dynamic Report Generation:**
    -  Generate and display statistical reports dynamically within the webpage.
    -  Use DOM manipulation to update the interface in real-time.
  - **User Interaction and Event Handling:**
    - Implement event-driven programming to respond to user actions such as form submissions and navigation clicks.
    - Dynamically update the interface based on user inputs.
